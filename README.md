# Role Playing Game Exercise - Scrimba Module 7: Next-Level JavaScript 

## About The Exercise

This Christmas App game was built from scratch to consolidate Module 7 learning. The game was invented by myself, and was adapted from the Scrimba role playing game used to demonstrate and practise the following JavaScript skills and concepts:  

- Destructuring objects
- Mapping over arrays
- The array constructor and the .fill() method
- Chaining methods
- Constructor functions
- Object.assign()
- importing and exporting 
- The .reduce() method
- The ternary operator
- Arrow functions
- setTimeout

The project is designed for mobile phone screens, so has minimal responsiveness.

The inclusion of a dice-roll effect fulfils the suggested stretch goal for this exercise.
